# Zenchain NFT Minter

A minimal NFT minter dApp for Zenchain.  
Includes a simple ERC-721 contract (contracts/ZenNFT.sol) and a static frontend (index.html) that connects with MetaMask.

## What it does
- Allows a user to call mint(tokenURI) to mint an ERC-721 NFT to their address.
- Shows the total number of NFTs minted via totalSupply().
- Frontend is static (no build step). After deploying the contract, you only need to update the contract address in script.js.

## Files
- contracts/ZenNFT.sol → The Solidity contract.
- index.html → Frontend interface for minting NFTs.
- script.js → Handles MetaMask connection and contract interactions.

## Deployment (Optional but recommended)
1. Open https://remix.ethereum.org.
2. Create ZenNFT.sol under contracts/ and paste the contract code.
3. Compile with Solidity 0.8.19.
4. Connect MetaMask to Zenchain testnet (RPC/Chain ID from Zenchain docs/community).
5. Deploy the contract and copy the deployed address.
6. Update CONTRACT_ADDRESS in script.js with the deployed contract address.

## Run the frontend
- Open index.html locally in a browser or publish via GitHub Pages:
  1. Repository → Settings → Pages → Source → main branch → / (root) → Save.
  2. Wait a minute. Your frontend will be live at:
     ```

     ```
